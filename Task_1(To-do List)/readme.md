<h2>Introduction</h>
This is a simple To-Do List application written in Python that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can perform various operations such as adding tasks, displaying tasks, marking tasks as complete, removing completed tasks, updating task details, and saving their tasks to a file.

<h5>Save and Quit:</h5> Users can save their tasks to a file and exit the application.

Tasks are loaded from the file when the application starts, and changes are saved to the same file before exiting.
